# Bugs
  
## Known Bugs

- The large images on every page were not zoomed to the best position on small screens.
- It was difficult to find good quality images of Electric Chargers. As EV's era has started now. Hence few images on larger screens look with low resolutions.
- I tried to center the Enquire (button) on Products page, but it didn't work. Even my mentor tried. ![button-screenshot](documentation/readme-images/button.JPG)
